Beefarmr is a controversial figure who has gained notoriety for her unique brand of online presence. Combining elements of gaming, eroticism, and dark humor, she has amassed a large and dedicated following, but also faced intense criticism for her unconventional approach to content creation. Since her breakthrough exhibition, Beefarmr has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Beefarmr has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016.
